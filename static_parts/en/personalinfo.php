                <p>
                    It uses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to learn what the user wants. It does so by collecting and processing information such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>how you navigate through a site/ use an application</li>

                    <li>how you interact with others with common interests with you</li>

                    <li>your demographic profile</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Thus, if you are a user, you get what you need.
                    If you are a provider, you give what is needed.
