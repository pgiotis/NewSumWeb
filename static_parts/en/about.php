        <h4> What is NewSum?</h4>
        <p> NewSum automatically summarizes information 
            from many sources and combines them in a single text.<br>
            It gives you the main points (something like “tweets”) 
            of all the different information that you would get if 
            you read all the articles from the sources you visit 
            (or that you would like to have time to visit...)
            <br>With the use of cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology, news are summarised and all repeated information is not duplicated.
            What is more, you always have access to the news sources.</p>
